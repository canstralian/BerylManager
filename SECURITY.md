## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in BerylManager, please help us keep users safe by reporting it **privately**:

- Email: **[your-security-contact@example.com]**
- Subject line: `SECURITY: [short description]`

⚠️ **Do not open a public GitHub issue for security problems.**  
This ensures vulnerabilities aren’t exploited before a fix is available.

When reporting, please provide:
- A clear description of the issue
